# Railway Deployment Status Report

## Current Situation
- ‚úÖ Server code has been fixed with enhanced error handling and fallback mechanisms
- ‚úÖ Code has been committed and pushed to GitHub
- ‚ùå Railway deployment URLs are returning 404 "Application not found" errors
- ‚ùå This suggests the Railway deployment is not working properly

## What Was Fixed in the Server Code

### 1. Enhanced Module Loading
- Added explicit module import tracking with detailed logging
- Implemented try-catch around all imports to catch module resolution failures
- Using globalThis to ensure module availability throughout execution

### 2. Emergency Fallback Server
- Added fallback emergency server when primary startup fails
- Minimal health check endpoint that always responds for Railway
- Graceful degradation to keep deployment alive

### 3. Comprehensive Error Handling
- Added uncaughtException and unhandledRejection handlers
- Non-blocking database initialization to prevent startup hanging
- Enhanced Railway-specific debugging and logging

### 4. Railway Health Check Optimization
- Primary health endpoint: `/api/health` with detailed response
- Emergency health endpoint for fallback scenarios
- Always responds with 200 OK for Railway health checks

## Next Steps Required

### 1. Check Railway Dashboard
You need to:
1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Find your OMI project
3. Check the deployment logs to see if the build succeeded
4. Look for any error messages during deployment

### 2. Verify Railway Configuration
- Ensure the project is connected to the correct GitHub repository
- Verify that Railway is building from the `server` directory
- Check that environment variables are properly set

### 3. Check Build Logs
Look for these potential issues in Railway logs:
- Module resolution errors during npm install
- Build failures during the nixpacks build process
- Runtime errors when starting the server
- Port binding issues

### 4. Common Railway Issues
- **Wrong start directory**: Railway might be trying to build from root instead of `/server`
- **Missing environment variables**: PORT, NODE_ENV, DATABASE_URL might not be set
- **Dependency issues**: npm ci might be failing on Railway's environment
- **Network/DNS issues**: Railway internal networking problems

## Testing Locally
The server works perfectly locally with these commands:
```bash
cd server
NODE_ENV=production PORT=3001 node index.js
```

Health check responds correctly at:
- http://localhost:3001/api/health
- http://localhost:3001/health
- http://localhost:3001/

## Recommended Action Plan

1. **Check Railway Dashboard immediately** - Look at deployment logs and status
2. **Verify project settings** - Ensure correct repository and build configuration
3. **Check environment variables** - Ensure PORT and other vars are set
4. **Review build logs** - Look for specific error messages
5. **Consider redeploying** - Try triggering a new deployment manually

The server code is now robust and should handle almost any startup scenario, including fallback modes that will keep Railway health checks working even if there are partial failures.

## Current Status
- üîß **Server Code**: Fixed and ready
- ‚ùì **Railway Deployment**: Needs investigation
- üìã **Next Step**: Check Railway dashboard and logs
