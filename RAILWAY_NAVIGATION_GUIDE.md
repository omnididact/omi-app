# 🧭 Railway Dashboard Navigation Guide

## 🔍 Finding Your Services/Deployments

Railway's interface has changed over time. Here's how to find your backend:

### Method 1: Project View
1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Click on your **project name** (might be "omi-app" or similar)
3. You should see boxes/cards representing different services:
   - PostgreSQL database
   - Your application deployment

### Method 2: Look for These Elements
In your Railway project, look for:
- **Boxes or Cards** representing deployments
- **GitHub icon** with your repo name
- **PostgreSQL icon** for your database

### Method 3: Check the URL Structure
Your project URL might be:
- `https://railway.app/project/[PROJECT-ID]`
- Click around to find the main application (not PostgreSQL)

## 🎯 What You're Looking For

**Your Backend Service Will Show:**
- Connected to GitHub repository
- Environment variables like `JWT_SECRET`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Recent deployments
- A public URL (the one that's showing React content)

**NOT the PostgreSQL Service:**
- Shows database connection details
- No GitHub connection
- Database-specific settings

## 📱 Alternative: Check Your Project Structure

If you can't find separate services, your Railway might be configured as:
1. **One service** that's supposed to be backend only
2. **Connected to your GitHub repo**
3. **Currently deploying the wrong directory**

## 🔧 Once You Find It

Look for these settings (names vary):
- **"Root Directory"**
- **"Source Directory"** 
- **"Build Command"**
- **"Start Command"**

## 📞 Can You Tell Me:
1. What do you see when you go to railway.app/dashboard?
2. How many "boxes" or "cards" do you see in your project?
3. Do any of them show a GitHub connection?
