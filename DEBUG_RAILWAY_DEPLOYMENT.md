# 🔍 Railway Deployment Debug Steps

## Current Issue: Health Check Failing
Health check is getting "service unavailable" which means the server isn't responding at all.

## Immediate Debug Steps

### 1. Check Railway Deployment Logs
**In Railway Dashboard:**
1. Go to your "omi-app" service
2. Click on **"Deployments"** tab
3. Click on the **latest deployment**
4. Look for these messages in the logs:

**Success indicators to look for:**
- ✅ `🚀 OMI API server running on port XXXX`
- ✅ `✅ Database initialized after server start`
- ✅ No error messages

**Error indicators to look for:**
- ❌ `Error:` messages
- ❌ `Failed to` messages
- ❌ Port binding errors
- ❌ Module import errors

### 2. Check Server Binding
The server might not be binding to `0.0.0.0` (Railway requirement).

### 3. Common Issues
- **Port binding**: Server needs to bind to `0.0.0.0:PORT` not `localhost:PORT`
- **Environment variables**: Missing or incorrect values
- **Import errors**: Module loading failures
- **Database connection**: Still blocking server startup

## What to Look For in Logs

**If you see:**
- `listening on port` → Good, server started
- `EADDRINUSE` → Port conflict
- `Cannot find module` → Import error
- `Connection refused` → Database connection blocking

## Next Steps Based on Log Findings

1. **If no server start message**: There's a startup error
2. **If server starts but health check fails**: Port binding issue
3. **If import errors**: Missing dependencies or file paths
4. **If database errors**: Connection string or permissions
